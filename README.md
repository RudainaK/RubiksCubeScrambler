# Description
This is a quick program I made that provides a sequence of moves to scramble the cube. I decided to make it after getting really into cubing two years ago. 

# How to run 
Compile by running the following in the terminal:

```
gcc Scrambler.c
```

Note, if you're on windows you'll need either WSL or to install gcc.

Then type 

```
a.out
```

Assuming you didn't rename it. You'll be greeted with the following prompt:

```
How many moves? If you want the default, input 0: 
```

The default is 25 moves. Here is a sample produced after inputing 10.

```
R L D2 U2 B' R U2 B2 R2 L2
```
